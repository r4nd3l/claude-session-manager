# What is Agent Session Manager?

Agent Session Manager is a native Linux desktop app that gives your AI
coding-agent sessions a proper home. It supports
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) today, with more agents (such as
Cursor) on the way.

If you use a coding agent daily, you accumulate **dozens of sessions** scattered
across every project you touch. They live as JSONL transcripts named by UUID
(Claude Code, for instance, stores them under `~/.claude/projects/`) — there's
no overview, no way to name them, and no quick way to tell which one was which.
The agent's own `--resume` only shows a picker for the current directory.

This app fixes that. It scans every session on your machine, presents them in
a searchable sidebar grouped by project, lets you **name and star** the ones
that matter, and opens any of them in an **embedded terminal tab** that resumes
it right where the session started.

::: tip Unofficial community tool
Agent Session Manager is an independent community project, not affiliated with
or endorsed by any agent vendor (including Anthropic). It is strictly read-only
with respect to your agents' data — names, favorites, and all app state live in
`~/.config/agent-session-manager/`. Your transcripts are never modified.

## Why use it?

- **One place for everything.** Every session, every project, newest first —
  instead of UUID-named files and per-directory pickers.
- **Human-readable.** Rename `a3b2152e…` to “JWT auth”, star your daily
  drivers, add an emoji to a tab.
- **Work in parallel.** Open several sessions as tabs. Status dots and desktop
  notifications tell you when a background session has finished.
- **Stay oriented.** Search the sidebar, search a terminal's scrollback, and
  peek at a session's recent messages before resuming it.

## How it compares

Coding agents are terminal programs, and you can absolutely keep using them
bare. Agent Session Manager is a layer *on top* — it doesn't replace the CLI, it
launches and organizes it:

| | Bare `--resume` | Agent Session Manager |
| --- | --- | --- |
| See all sessions across projects | ❌ | ✅ |
| Custom names & favorites | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multiple sessions side by side | Manual terminals | ✅ Tabs |
| "Which session was this?" | Read the UUID | ✅ Preview, details, peek |
| Finished-in-the-background alerts | ❌ | ✅ Notifications |
