# How It Works

## Reading sessions

Each supported agent stores its sessions as JSONL transcripts — Claude Code,
for example, writes them under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<uuid>.jsonl`. Agent Session Manager scans
that directory, reads a small prefix of each transcript to extract the project
directory and a message preview, and watches the folder with a
`Gio.FileMonitor` so the list stays live.

It **only reads** these files. The single action that writes to a transcript is
"Move to trash", which sends the file to your system trash (recoverable) behind
a confirmation.

## App state

Custom names, emoji, favorites, hidden sessions, and preferences are stored
separately in `~/.config/agent-session-manager/state.json`. This keeps the
app's data fully decoupled from the agents' own — you can delete the config at
any time without affecting a single session.

## Terminals

Each tab embeds a [VTE](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte) terminal — the same
widget behind GNOME Terminal and Ptyxis. The app spawns your `$SHELL` and types
the agent's resume command (e.g. `claude --resume <id>`) into it, so your
aliases and environment apply and you drop back to a prompt when the agent
exits.

## The stack

Agent Session Manager is built with **GTK4**, **libadwaita**, **VTE**, and
**PyGObject** — pure Python, no build step. VTE is the deciding factor: it's the
only production-grade embeddable terminal on Linux, which is why the app is
Linux-native. The data layer (session discovery, parsing, state) is GTK-free
and unit-tested.
