    title: Every session, organized
    details: A sidebar of all your agent sessions, grouped by project, with a pinned Favorites section, live updates, and search.
  - icon: 🖥️
    title: Embedded terminals
    details: Click a session to resume it in a real VTE terminal tab — in its original project directory, inside your own shell.
  - icon: 🏷️
    title: Name & tag freely
    details: Give sessions custom names and tabs emoji prefixes. Everything is stored app-side; your agents' own data is never touched.

    title: Stays out of your way
    details: Status dots and desktop notifications tell you when a background session has finished, so you can work across many at once.
  - icon: 🔍
    title: Find anything
    details: Search the sidebar, search within a terminal's scrollback, and peek at a session's recent messages without resuming it.
  - icon: 🐧
    title: Native GTK4
    details: Built with GTK4, libadwaita, and VTE. Installs as a .deb or runs from source. GPL-3.0, open source.
